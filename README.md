# A React Project - Movie Finder App

 * In this project, I've created a simple UI to search for a movie.
 * Basically you are entering a query string to search and the app returns related movie list. 
 * Then you can also see the movie details like release date, user rating, summary, duration, actors etc...
 * All the images and information are taken from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
 * [Feel free to look at here]().
