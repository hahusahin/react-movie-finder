# A React Project - Movie Finder App

 * <h2> https://ecstatic-mccarthy-a3beb5.netlify.app/ </h2>
 * In this project, I've created a simple UI to search for a movie.
 * Basically you are entering a query string to search and the app returns related movie list. 
 * Then you can also see the movie details like release date, user rating, summary, duration, actors etc...
 * You can also filter the results based on genre, adult etc as well as sort by release date and rating.
 * There is also "Load More" ability to load more movies.
 * All the images and information are taken from The Movie Database.
